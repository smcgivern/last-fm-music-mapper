Small [Scotty](https://github.com/scotty-web/scotty) app that makes
music maps from [Last.fm](https://last.fm/) profiles.

The artist countries are determined by the tags assigned to each artist. This
means that many are missing or wrong (for instance, Ana√Øs Mitchell is from
Vermont, but has tags for 'united kingdom'). Still, that's the cost of using
free data.
