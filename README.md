Small [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) app that makes music maps from
[Last.fm](http://last.fm/) profiles.

The artist countries are determined by the tags assigned to each artist. This
means that many are missing or wrong (for instance, Ana√Øs Mitchell is from
Vermont, but has tags for 'united kingdom'). Still, that's the cost of using
free data.

The API client for Last.fm is at `lib/last_fm.rb` while `lib/music_mapper.rb`
does the bulk of the work in gluing everything together.
